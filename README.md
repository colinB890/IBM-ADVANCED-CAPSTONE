# IBM-ADVANCED-CAPSTONE Colin Burgess
Final assignment in partial fulfillment of IBM Advanced Capstone


What a morbid assignment, but I have philosophical thoughts on the death penalty, and it is a wide array of data which touches on areas of psychology, and could yield much fruit in the area of data analysis. There are many questions one might ask of such data. Here, I am curious to see if there are factors such as race, age and sex which might have anything to do with who is "targeted" for the death penalty in the US.  I have chosen a linear regression model for this assignment due to the nature of the data.

I would like to further explore this data subsequent to this assignment, to see if there are other meaningful questions which one might ask of it, but for now this will have to do.

Colin.
